# Roadmap Planning Standard

`docs/ROADMAP.md` is the source of truth for what we build next. Before implementing any roadmap item, write an ExecPlan that targets one concrete slice (one phase + one feature). Follow `.agents/PLANS.md` exactly for format and content.

ExecPlans live in `docs/plan-<phase>-<topic>.md` (lowercase, hyphenated). Keep plans small and opinionated: each plan must name the roadmap phase it covers, define the user-visible outcome, and spell out how to validate it in this repo. Update the plan as work proceeds.
